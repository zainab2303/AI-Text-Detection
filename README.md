This repository is a collection of all the algorithms/models I implemented from scratch
1. # Text Detection and Generation:
    Bigram and Trigram Text Generation code implemented from scratch using only Numpy.
    Code is written taking into account the mathematical formaulas alone.
    This is a good mathematical insight into how generative AI works
2. # MaxFlow
•	Designed and implemented a Python program to address material shipping from California (CA) to every other state in the USA using Max Flow.

•	 Developed a graph to compute a flow with demands over a given directed graph, where nodes represent states and are annotated with 'demand' properties, and edges are annotated with 'capacity' properties.

• Successfully computed a flow networkx, ensuring that each state received the required number of movie copies while efficiently managing shipping logistics

3. # Illiad Graph: Python Graph Analysis Project

• Developed a Python program to parse character interaction data from Homer’s Illiad and represent it as an undirected graph.

•	Implemented a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the graph, ensuring nodes were visited in alphabetical order.

•	Utilized DFS to identify connected components in the graph, iterating over unvisited nodes and running DFS from each to discover connected nodes.

• Analyzed the dataset to figure out the complex relationship between the characters from Illiad to better understand and formulate the text
